📊 Statistics Lecture 5 Notes: Key Concepts

This lecture revisits key probability rules, introduces probability distributions (Binomial and Normal), explains the Central Limit Theorem, and provides detailed help for your first coursework assignment.

1. Revision: Key Probability Rules

These are foundational rules from your previous lecture.

    Addition Rule (The "OR" Rule): Used to find the probability of event A or event B happening.

        Formula: Pr(A or B)=Pr(A)+Pr(B)−Pr(A and B).

Explanation: You must subtract the probability of both happening (A and B) to avoid "double counting" the overlap. A Venn diagram helps visualize this overlap.

Special Case: If events are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen at the same time), then Pr(A and B)=0, and the rule simplifies to: Pr(A or B)=Pr(A)+Pr(B).

Multiplication Rule (The "AND" Rule): Used to find the probability of event A and event B both happening.

    Formula: Pr(A and B)=Pr(A)×Pr(B∣A).

Explanation: Pr(B∣A) is the conditional probability—the probability of B happening, given that A has already happened.

Special Case: If events are independent (one event does not affect the other), then Pr(B∣A) is simply Pr(B), and the rule simplifies to: Pr(A and B)=Pr(A)×Pr(B).

2. Revision: The Combinatorial Formula (nCr)

    Purpose: This formula tells you the number of ways you can choose a smaller group (r) of items from a larger set (n), when the order you choose them in doesn't matter.

Example: You have 5 ambulances (n=5) and need to choose 2 (r=2). The formula 5C2​ calculates that there are 10 possible combinations.

Excel Function: You can calculate this in Excel using the function: =COMBIN(n, r) (e.g., =COMBIN(5, 2)).

3. Probability Distributions

This was the main new topic, showing how probabilities are spread across different outcomes.

The Binomial Distribution

This distribution is used when your data has only two possible outcomes (e.g., "ready" or "not ready," "success" or "failure").

    Example: The lecture uses an ambulance example where the probability of being 'ready' is 0.9 and 'not ready' is 0.1.

The slides show tables for the probability of having x number of ambulances ready when the total n is 1 , 2 , 5 , 16 , and 31 .

Key Insight: As n (the number of ambulances) gets larger, the graph of the distribution becomes more symmetrical and starts to look like a "bell curve".

The Normal Distribution (The "Bell Curve")

This is a very common and important symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution.

    Key Features:

        Peak: The highest point of the curve is at the mean (average) of the data.

Probability: The probability of an outcome is represented by the area under the curve.

Example: Women's heights are "normally distributed" with a mean of 166 cm . This means the bell curve for women's heights would peak at 166 cm .

Finding Probabilities: To find the probability of a woman being taller than 175 cm, you would calculate the total area under the curve to the right of the 175 cm mark .

4. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

This is one of the most important theorems in statistics.

    What it is: The CLT states that if you take a large number of random samples from any population, the distribution of the sample means will tend to follow a normal distribution (a bell curve). This works even if the original population was not normally distributed.

How it's Shown: The slides show histograms where the sample size n increases from 10 to 25 to 50. As n gets bigger, the histogram of the sample means looks more and more like a smooth, normal distribution.

Effect of Sample Size: A separate diagram shows two normal distributions for sample means:

    One for a smaller sample size (n=25) which is wider and flatter.

One for a larger sample size (n=100) which is taller and narrower.

This means: Larger samples give you a more precise estimate of the true population mean (the sample means are more tightly clustered around the true value).

5. 📝 Coursework 1 Guidance

This is a practical guide to your first assessed task.

    The Task: You must analyze an Excel file containing data on UK healthcare. You will then create a PowerPoint presentation (maximum 10 slides) to summarize what you can learn from the data.

Deadline: 14th November 2025.

Main Goal: The most important part is the analysis in Excel. You need to spend several hours understanding the data to find a "clear message" about which parts of the UK seem to have the worst healthcare, based on the data provided . The PowerPoint creation itself should only take 1-2 hours.

Suggested 10-Slide Structure:

    Slide 1: Title

        Include the module title and your name or student number.

Slide 2: Overview

    Briefly state what your presentation is about.

Slides 3-8: Analysis

    This is the main body. Include your tables and charts from Excel.

Crucially: You must explain what your charts tell us.

WARNING: Copy and paste your tables/charts directly into PowerPoint. Do NOT use hyperlinks to your Excel or OneDrive files, as the markers (John and Vince) will not be able to access them.

Slide 9: Conclusion

    Summarize the key findings. What can we learn from your analysis? 

Slide 10: References

    You must include this specific reference for the data:

Simister J. (2025), ‘Data selected by John Simister, for assessed coursework 1 of the Introduction to Statistics module’.

Also, add any other sources you used (e.g., statistics textbook).

Optional Audio/Video:

    You can include audio or video recordings of yourself explaining the slides.

This can raise your mark but is not required to pass.

Keep it short: No more than 5 minutes in total.

File Size Limit: The entire PowerPoint file must be under 100MB to upload to Moodle. Use low-resolution video if your file is too big.

6. 📅 Admin & Announcements

    Feedback: A mid-module feedback survey is available.

No Class Next Week: There is no lecture or tutorial for this module in Week 6 (week commencing 3rd November).

Careers Week: Week 6 is dedicated to career-ready events.
