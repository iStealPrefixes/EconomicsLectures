The Aggregate Demand (AD) Model

This lecture uses a model of Aggregate Demand (AD) to understand how the economy can fluctuate and how government spending can help stabilize it.

The Consumption Function

Aggregate consumption (C) has two main parts:

    Autonomous Consumption (c0​): This is the fixed amount a household will spend regardless of its current income (e.g., on basic needs). It is also influenced by expectations about the future.

Consumption Dependent on Income (c1​Y): This is the part of consumption that changes with current income (Y).

The "slope" of this relationship is called the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC), or c1​. It's the fraction of an extra dollar of income that is spent on consumption.

    MPC (c1​): We assume c1​ is positive but less than 1 (e.g., 0.6). This means if you get £1 extra income, you spend 60p and save 40p.

Varies by household: Poorer, credit-constrained households have a high MPC (they spend most of any new income) , while wealthy households have a low MPC.

The full consumption function is written as: C=c0​+c1​Y.

Goods Market Equilibrium

In a simple model, Aggregate Demand is consumption plus investment:

AD=C+I AD=c0​+c1​Y+I

    We assume Investment (I) is fixed and doesn't depend on current income (Y).

The economy is in equilibrium when the amount produced (Output, Y) equals the amount demanded (AD).

On a graph, this equilibrium is where the AD line crosses the 45-degree line (where Y=AD).

The Multiplier Effect

The multiplier effect is a key concept: an initial change in spending (like a fall in investment) leads to a larger total change in national output (Y).

Here’s the process (e.g., for a fall in investment):

    Initial Shock: Investment (I) falls.

    Round 1: This directly lowers AD. Firms cut production, so output (Y) and income fall by the same amount.

    Round 2: People now have lower incomes. Because their income (Y) is lower, they cut their consumption (C) (based on their MPC, c1​).

    Round 3: This cut in consumption is another fall in AD. Firms cut production and income again.

    ...and so on: This process repeats, with each fall in income leading to a further (but smaller) fall in consumption, until a new, lower equilibrium is reached.

The total fall in output is a multiple of the initial fall in investment.

What Else Affects AD?

Household Wealth and Consumption

    A household's wealth (assets minus debt) influences its autonomous consumption (c0​).

Households have a target broad wealth.

If wealth falls below the target (e.g., due to a fall in house prices or expected future earnings), households will cut consumption and increase saving to rebuild their wealth. This is called precautionary saving.

This happened in the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis, where falling house prices and negative expectations caused consumption to drop sharply.

Investment (I)

Firms decide whether to invest by comparing two things:

    The net profit rate on the investment (Π).

The interest rate (r), which is the cost of borrowing or the return on saving.

Decision Rule: Invest if Π>r. Therefore, a lower interest rate makes investment more likely. However, negative expectations about future demand can stop investment even if interest rates are low.

The Full AD Model (with Government and Trade)

We can add the government and international trade to the AD formula:

AD=C+I+G+NX

    G (Government Spending): Assumed to be exogenous (not dependent on Y).

NX (Net Exports): This is Exports (X) minus Imports (M).

    Exports (X): Assumed exogenous.

Imports (M): Depend on domestic income (Y). The fraction of extra income spent on imports is the marginal propensity to import (m).

C (Consumption): Now depends on disposable (after-tax) income. If t is the tax rate, consumers spend c1​(1−t)Y.

Full AD Equation: AD=c0​+c1​(1−t)Y+I(r)+G+X−mY

Leakages and the Multiplier

Taxes (t) and imports (m), along with saving, are called "leakages" from the circular flow of income. They reduce the size of the multiplier because some of the income is "leaked" out (to the government or abroad) instead of being spent on domestic goods.

A smaller multiplier means the AD curve is flatter.

The Government's Role in Stabilizing the Economy

The government can stabilize the economy during fluctuations.

Automatic Stabilizers

Some policies automatically offset booms and recessions without new government action.

    Unemployment Benefits: In a recession, more people get benefits, which supports their consumption.

Tax Rate: In a recession, people earn less and pay less tax, which cushions the fall in their disposable income. A higher tax rate (t) also lowers the multiplier, making the economy less volatile.

Fiscal Stimulus

This is a deliberate government action to counteract a recession. The government can:

    Increase Government Spending (G): This directly increases AD.

Cut Taxes (t): This encourages private households and firms to spend more.

Because of the multiplier effect, the total increase in output (Y) from a rise in G will be greater than the initial increase in G.

Austerity, Deficits, and Debt

    Budget Deficit: A fiscal stimulus usually causes a budget deficit (G>T).

Government Debt: Persistent deficits lead to rising government debt. This is measured by the Debt-to-GDP ratio.

Austerity: This is the opposite of stimulus (cutting spending or raising taxes) to reduce debt. The danger is that austerity during a recession can reinforce the downturn by further reducing AD.
